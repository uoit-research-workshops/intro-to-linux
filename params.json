{"name":"Intro-to-linux","tagline":"This contains files and documentation for the intro to Linux workshop put on by the Physics society at UOIT. ","body":"###Overview\r\nThis is an intro to using Linux. We will go over basic skills and plotting data using gnuplot. You should have Linux installed on your laptop. If you do not and would like to come to this workshop please email info@uoitphysics.ca. \r\n\r\n###Tutorial\r\nDownload the data files using the tar.gz button above. Open up a terminal from the menu or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl-Alt-t. Type (without the $)\r\n\r\n    $ ls\r\n\r\nwhich lists the contents of the current directory. The file that we downloaded will be in your Downloads folder. To get into this folder type \r\n\r\n    $ cd Downloads\r\n\r\nwhere 'cd' is the command to change directories and Downloads is the name of the folder that you want to get into. To see the name of the directory you are in type \r\n\r\n    $ pwd\r\n\r\nwhich gives the full path to the directory. Check that the data file downloaded correctly and then go back to your home directory. Do to this run the commands\r\n\r\n    $ ls\r\n    $ cd ../\r\n\r\nwhere cd ../ means move up a directory. We are going to copy the data file to a new directory so we can do some analysis on it. To do so we need to do a few things first. First go into your documents folder then create a directory called balloon_data. To do so run the commands\r\n\r\n    $ cd Documents\r\n    $ mkdir balloon_data\r\n\r\nwhere mkdir is the command to make a directory. Go into balloon_data and get the path to the directory by running\r\n\r\n    $ cd balloon_data\r\n    $ pwd\r\n\r\nGo back to your home directory by typing\r\n\r\n    $ cd\r\n\r\nwith no arguments. To copy the balloon data to balloon_data go into your downloads and run the command \r\n\r\n    $ cp space_data.csv /path/to/balloon_data\r\n\r\nwhich used the command cp to copy files. If we want to move the file instead run\r\n\r\n    $ mv space_data.csv /path/to/balloon_data\r\n\r\nGo to the directory with the data where we will look at the file. We can look at the file in a variety of ways. Run the commands\r\n\r\n    $ cd /path/to/balloon_data\r\n    $ head space_data.csv\r\n    $ tail space_data.csv \r\n    $ less space_data.csv\r\n\r\nPress 'q' to quit less. If we want to edit the file we will need to use a text editor. \r\n\r\nFirst let's play around with using vim which is a command line text editor. Run the command \r\n\r\n    $ vi example.txt\r\n\r\nto create a file called example.txt. Press i or Insert to go into insert mode and start typing. Type whatever you want. To save and quit type 'Esc + : + wq'. Open the file again and add something else. To quit without saving type 'Esc + : + q!'. Let's get rid of our example file. To do so type \r\n\r\n    $ rm example.txt\r\n\r\nhowever you should be careful when using rm! There is no recycle bin in Linux so once a file is gone you cannot recover it. \r\n\r\nWe are now almost ready to plot our balloon data. First we need to install gnuplot. To do so run\r\n\r\n    $ sudo apt-get install gnuplot-x11\r\n\r\nWe will be plotting data contained in the files in the data_files directory. We will build the gnuplot scripts from scratch but completed ones are given in the gnuplot_scripts directory. To run a gnuplot script use the command\r\n\r\n    $ gnuplot my_gnuplot_script.gp\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nHere are some useful resources:\r\n- [Google](https://www.google.ca/)\r\n\r\n- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)\r\n\r\n- [Linux for noobs subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs)\r\n\r\n- [Linux subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/)\r\n\r\n- [Gnuplot examples](http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/demo/)\r\n\r\n- [Gnuplot colours](http://www.uni-hamburg.de/Wiss/FB/15/Sustainability/schneider/gnuplot/colors.htm)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
